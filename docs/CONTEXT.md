# PMM Deep Agent Context

## Project Purpose

PMM Deep Agent evaluates and creates B2B product marketing assets using proven frameworks. It's designed for:

1. **PMMs** who want quick, expert-level analysis of their homepage and messaging
2. **Founders** who need positioning guidance without hiring a consultant
3. **Marketers** who want to identify messaging weaknesses fast

## PMM Frameworks Used

### April Dunford's Positioning

The agent uses April Dunford's positioning methodology from "Obviously Awesome":

1. **Competitive Alternatives** - What would customers use if you didn't exist?
2. **Unique Attributes** - What features/capabilities do only you have?
3. **Value** - What benefit do those attributes enable?
4. **Target Customers** - Who cares most about that value?
5. **Market Category** - What context makes your value obvious?

### Fletch PMM Messaging Hierarchy

The agent evaluates messaging using the Fletch framework:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           Strategic Narrative           │
│    (The big story you're part of)      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│           Positioning Statement         │
│      (Your unique market position)      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│           Value Propositions            │
│     (3-4 key benefits for buyers)       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│        Proof Points / Evidence          │
│    (Stats, testimonials, features)      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 5-Second Test

The agent runs a cognitive 5-second test asking:
- What do they do?
- Who is it for?
- What makes it different?
- What should I do next?

## Inspiration
